# DevOps & Cloud Engineering Learning

Hi, I'm Theophilus 👋
I'm building hands-on skills to transition into DevOps / Cloud Engineering.

This repository documents my practical learning through:
- Linux fundamentals
- Git & GitHub workflows
- Bash scripting
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS)
- Containers, CI/CD, and Infrastructure as Code

## Current Focus
- Linux terminal fundamentals
- File systems & permissions
- Processes & networking
- Git basics

## Repository Structure
- `linux-basics/` – Linux commands, notes, and exercises
- `scripts/` – Bash scripts and automation
- `cloud/` – Cloud labs and deployments
- `ci-cd/` – Pipelines and automation
- `terraform/` – Infrastructure as Code
- `kubernetes/` – Container orchestration

## Goal
Build production-ready DevOps skills and a strong public portfolio of real, hands-on work.
